Project Title: Exploring Detailed Chicago Police Arrest Data

## Project Summary 
This data is based on a preimilary analysis of detailed arrest data from the Chicago Data Portal. The data is significant becuase the data, at times, has not been avaialble at all, or it was available without certain datapoints.
For instance, these arrest records contain the datetime stamps for arrest, lockup, release from lockup and bond date. 


Based on a bulk download of this data, we transformed several columns to help make sense of the data. 
For example, we extracted year, month, and time of day into separate fields. In addition, we classified every charge into a set of grouped categories.

## This Data
This is a redacted version of the primary data set that removes information such as name, cb number, and date.
